# Content API
## IBM Cloud

## Introduction
This application is a quick test of an improved development environment and build system for the "scenario" and "solutions" static content pages.

### Content Authors and Designers
For content authors, this application aims to provide a CMS layer that can make use of a standardized set of templates to build out the "scenario" and "solutions" pages for the IBM Cloud marketplace.

### Developers
For developers, this application aims to provide an improved build system in which SASS is linted and images are optimized programmatically throughout the development process. In this environment, developers should also be able to make use of page templates to reduce unnecessary duplication of markup. Finally, Rake will provide a command line tool for building and deploying pages.
